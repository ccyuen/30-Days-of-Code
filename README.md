My personal solutions to the coding challenges that Hackerrank provides.

## 30-Days-of-Code
Coding challenges from Hackerrank
> - Coding challenges released every day for 30 days to be completed and submitted       
> - These challenges are more tutorial based in which they also allow a slow progression and introduction of the chosen language to more complex algorithms and data structures
